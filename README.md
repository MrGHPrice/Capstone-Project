### Lending Club Loanbook Analysis

#### Data
1.5 million loans from the Lending Clubs Loanbook, downloaded directly from their site (https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action)

#### Dictionary
Set of definitions for each column value describing data.

#### Objective
I will be aiming to create models to predict Loan Status, to confidently predict which loans will default. Also a model to predict interest rate offered. 
Exploring the possibility of combining these two models to see if I can predict whether a loan would have been fully repayed had it been offered at a lower interest rate (this is just an idea to explore at this point).

The aim of analysing this data to create a list of suggestions on how best to reduce the number of loans that default, thereby helping Lending Club to maximise their returns

Exploring possible new ways to group data (using clustering and NLP) to see if there are better ways to qualify applications, and either identify loans that should not have been approved, or improve on the Lending Clubs grading scale

#### Challenges
Learning the Data and Dictionary in order to search for the best route to increasing returns 
Knowing which columns to keep in my data cleaning
